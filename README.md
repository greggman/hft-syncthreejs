SyncThreeJS
===========

This is a demo that "happens" to use HappyFunTimes.
**It is not a game and does not run on phones.**

Instead it shows using HappyFunTimes to keep multiple
machines in sync. So for example if you wanted
to make a virtual display across multiple machines
this is one technique to do it.
